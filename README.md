# PF906-treadmill-motor-controller-
This is a description of the PF906 treadmill controller for study, repair and for application of the controller to other purposes.  You use this info at your own risk.

I intend to include Arduino software to drive this controller and when ready I'll add it.  Updates will not be frequent as its a labour of love. Id appreciate accreditation for the reverse engineering if you use this info for something that is then published. 

Any assistance or contributions are welcome.  

I will take it down if the rightful owner of the design requires it.
