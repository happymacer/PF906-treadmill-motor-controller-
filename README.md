# PF906-treadmill-motor-controller-
This is a description of the PF906 treadmill controller for study, repair and for application of the controller to other purposes.  You use this info at your own risk.

I have included simple Arduino software to drive this controller, but more important, I've also developed [code for the PIC microcontroller](https://github.com/happymacer/PF906-treadmill-motor-driver-control-code) to drive the motor.  Updates will not be frequent as its a labour of love. Id appreciate accreditation for the reverse engineering if you use this info for something that is then published. 

In Dec 21 I added the schematic of the controller and the LCD screens.  On another Github repository I have described [how to control the LCD's using an Arduino](https://github.com/happymacer/pf906-LCD-display).

Any assistance or contributions are welcome.  

I will take it down if the rightful owner of the design requires it.
